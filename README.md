# Dataset Description:

The dataset comprises information from a diverse group of individuals, including both diabetes-positive and diabetes-negative cases. It contains various features that have been identified as potential indicators or risk factors for diabetes, enabling the exploration of relationships between these factors and the disease's occurrence. It consists of significant predictors of diabetes, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The Kaggle-obtained Diabetes Dataset has 100,000 observations and 9 variables.

# Objective:

The objective of the EDA is to explore and analyze the dataset to gain a better understanding of the relationships between different variables and their potential impact on diabetes.
EDA will involve data visualization, summary statistics, and other exploratory techniques to identify patterns, trends, and potential insights in the data.
